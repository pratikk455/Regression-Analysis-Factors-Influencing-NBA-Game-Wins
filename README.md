# Regression Analysis Factors Influencing NBA Game Wins

Description:
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of NBA basketball game data, focusing on identifying and understanding the key factors that influence game outcomes. The analysis encompasses various stages, including data exploration, variable visualization, regression modeling, data transformation, data cleaning, model selection, cross-validation, and influence analysis.

The main objective of this project is to provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of NBA games and shed light on the factors that contribute significantly to a team's success or failure. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for NBA teams, coaches, and analysts.

Key Features:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: The repository includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain a deep understanding of the NBA game dataset. This stage involves descriptive statistics, data visualization, and interactive visualizations to reveal trends, distributions, and relationships among variables.

2. Variable Visualization: The repository provides a collection of visually appealing and informative plots and graphs, enabling users to visualize various NBA game variables. These visualizations help in identifying trends, correlations, and outliers, providing valuable insights into the data.

3. Regression Modeling: Several regression models are implemented to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables and predict game outcomes. These models employ advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to capture the complexity of NBA games accurately.

4. Data Transformation and Cleaning: The repository offers techniques for data transformation and cleaning to ensure the dataset's integrity and reliability. Data preprocessing methods, including feature scaling, handling missing values, and outlier detection, are employed to enhance the quality of the analysis.

5. Model Selection and Evaluation: Different regression models are compared and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics and cross-validation techniques. This stage helps in selecting the most suitable model for predicting NBA game outcomes accurately.

6. Influence Analysis: The repository provides methods for conducting influence analysis to identify influential factors that significantly impact NBA game outcomes. By understanding the relative importance of different variables, teams can prioritize their strategies and allocate resources accordingly.

Through this repository, NBA enthusiasts, analysts, and researchers can gain valuable insights into the factors that influence NBA games, paving the way for data-driven decision-making, performance improvement, and strategic planning. The code, documentation, and example datasets are readily available, empowering users to replicate and extend the analysis for their specific needs.

Note: The analysis in this repository is based on NBA basketball game data available up until September 2021.
